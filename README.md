# Server Survival 🖥️🔥

![Gameplay Demo](assets/gameplay.gif)

**Server Survival** is an interactive 3D simulation game where you play as a **Cloud Architect**. Your mission is to build and scale a resilient cloud infrastructure to handle increasing traffic loads while fighting off DDoS attacks and managing your budget.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
Survive as long as possible! Manage your **Budget ($)** and **Reputation (%)**.
- **Earn Money** by successfully processing legitimate traffic (Web & API).
- **Lose Reputation** if requests fail or if Fraud traffic slips through.
- **Game Over** if Reputation hits 0% or you go bankrupt.

### Traffic Types
- 🟢 **Web Traffic (Green):** Needs to be stored in **S3**.
- 🟠 **API Traffic (Orange):** Needs to be processed and saved to a **Database**.
- 🟣 **Fraud/DDoS (Pink):** Must be blocked by a **WAF**.

### Infrastructure & Services
Build your architecture using the toolbar. Each service has a cost and upkeep:

| Service | Cost | Upkeep | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WAF** | $40 | Low | **Firewall.** The first line of defense. Blocks Fraud traffic. |
| **SQS** | $40 | Low | **Queue.** Buffers requests during spikes. Prevents drops. |
| **ALB** | $50 | Medium | **Load Balancer.** Distributes traffic to multiple Compute instances. |
| **Compute** | $80 | High | **EC2 Instance.** Processes requests. **Upgradeable (Tiers 1-3).** |
| **ElastiCache** | $75 | Medium | **Redis Cache.** Caches responses to reduce DB load. |
| **Database** | $180 | Very High | **RDS.** Destination for API traffic. **Upgradeable (Tiers 1-3).** |
| **S3** | $30 | Low | **Storage.** Destination for Web traffic. |

### Scoring & Economy
- **Web Request:** +$0.80 / +5 Score
- **API Request:** +$1.20 / +8 Score
- **Fraud Blocked:** +10 Score
- **Fraud Leak:** -8 Reputation
- **Upkeep Scaling:** Costs increase 1x to 2x over 10 minutes.

### Game Modes

#### Survival Mode
The classic experience - survive as long as possible against escalating traffic.

#### Sandbox Mode
A fully customizable testing environment for experimenting with any architecture:

| Control | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Budget** | Set any starting budget (slider 0-10K, or type any amount) |
| **RPS** | Control traffic rate (0 = stopped, or type 100+ for stress tests) |
| **Traffic Mix** | Adjust WEB/API/FRAUD percentages independently |
| **Burst** | Spawn instant bursts of specific traffic types |
| **Upkeep Toggle** | Enable/disable service costs |
| **Clear All** | Reset all services and restore budget |

**No game over in Sandbox** - experiment freely!

### Last Features
- **Sandbox Mode:** Full control over budget, traffic rate, traffic mix, and burst spawning
- **Interactive Tutorial:** A guided walkthrough for new players in Survival Mode to learn the basics of building and scaling.

### Controls
- **Left Click:** Select tools, place services, and connect nodes.
- **Right Click + Drag:** Pan the camera.
- **ESC:** Open main menu and pause game. Press again or click Resume to close menu (stays paused).
- **Camera Reset:** Press `R` to reset the camera position.
- **Birds-Eye View:** Press `T` to switch between isometric and top-down view.
- **Hide HUD:** Press `H` to toggle UI panels.
- **Connect Tool:** Click two nodes to create a connection (flow direction matters!).
    - *Valid Flows:* Internet -> WAF -> ALB -> SQS -> Compute -> Cache -> (DB/S3)
- **Delete Tool:** Remove services to recover 50% of the cost.
- **Time Controls:** Pause, Play (1x), and Fast Forward (3x).

## 🧠 Strategy Tips
1.  **Block Fraud First:** Always place a WAF immediately connected to the Internet. Fraud leaks destroy reputation fast.
2.  **Scale Compute:** As traffic increases, a single Compute node won't be enough. Use an ALB to split traffic across multiple Compute nodes.
3.  **Watch Your Queues:** If a service's queue fills up (red ring), requests will fail. Add more capacity!
4.  **Budget Wisely:** Databases are expensive. Don't over-provision them early on.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D visualization.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the glassmorphism UI.
- **Build:** No build step required! Just standard HTML/CSS/JS.
