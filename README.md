# Server Survival

![Gameplay Demo](assets/gameplay.gif)

**Server Survival** is an interactive 3D simulation game where you play as a **Cloud Architect**. Your mission is to build and scale a resilient cloud infrastructure to handle increasing traffic loads while fighting off DDoS attacks, managing your budget, and keeping your services healthy.

## How to Play

### Objective

Survive as long as possible! Manage your **Budget ($)**, **Reputation (%)**, and **Service Health**.

- **Earn Money** by successfully processing legitimate traffic requests.
- **Lose Reputation** if requests fail or if malicious traffic slips through.
- **Maintain Health** - Services degrade under load and need repairs.
- **Game Over** if Reputation hits 0% or you go bankrupt ($-1000).

### Traffic Types

| Traffic       | Color  | Destination | Reward | Description                            |
| :------------ | :----- | :---------- | :----- | :------------------------------------- |
| **STATIC**    | Green  | S3 Storage  | $0.50  | Static file requests (images, CSS, JS) |
| **READ**      | Blue   | Database    | $0.80  | Database read operations               |
| **WRITE**     | Orange | Database    | $1.20  | Database write operations              |
| **UPLOAD**    | Yellow | S3 Storage  | $1.50  | File uploads                           |
| **SEARCH**    | Cyan   | Database    | $0.80  | Search queries (CPU intensive)         |
| **MALICIOUS** | Red    | WAF (Block) | $0.50  | DDoS/Attack traffic - must be blocked! |

### Infrastructure & Services

Build your architecture using the toolbar. Each service has a cost, capacity, and upkeep:

| Service      | Cost | Capacity  | Upkeep    | Function                                                           |
| :----------- | :--- | :-------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WAF**      | $40  | 30        | Low       | **Firewall.** First line of defense. Blocks malicious traffic.     |
| **SQS**      | $35  | Queue:200 | Low       | **Queue.** Buffers requests during spikes. Prevents drops.         |
| **ALB**      | $50  | 20        | Medium    | **Load Balancer.** Distributes traffic to multiple instances.      |
| **Compute**  | $60  | 4         | High      | **EC2 Instance.** Processes requests. **Upgradeable T1→T3.**       |
| **Cache**    | $60  | 30        | Medium    | **Redis Cache.** Caches responses to reduce DB load.               |
| **Database** | $150 | 8         | Very High | **RDS.** Destination for READ/WRITE/SEARCH. **Upgradeable T1→T3.** |
| **S3**       | $25  | 25        | Low       | **Storage.** Destination for STATIC/UPLOAD traffic.                |

### Scoring & Economy

| Action         | Money  | Score | Reputation |
| :------------- | :----- | :---- | :--------- |
| Static Request | +$0.50 | +3    | +0.1       |
| DB Read        | +$0.80 | +5    | +0.1       |
| DB Write       | +$1.20 | +8    | +0.1       |
| File Upload    | +$1.50 | +10   | +0.1       |
| Search Query   | +$0.80 | +5    | +0.1       |
| Attack Blocked | +$0.50 | +10   | -          |
| Request Failed | -      | -half | -1         |
| Attack Leaked  | -      | -     | -5         |

### Upkeep & Cost Scaling

- **Base Upkeep:** Each service has per-minute upkeep costs
- **Upkeep Scaling:** Costs increase 1x to 2x over 10 minutes
- **Repair Costs:** 15% of service cost to manually repair
- **Auto-Repair:** +10% upkeep overhead when enabled

### Game Modes

#### Survival Mode

The core experience - survive as long as possible against escalating traffic with constant intervention required:

**Dynamic Challenges:**

- **RPS Acceleration** - Traffic multiplies at time milestones (×1.3 at 1min → ×4.0 at 10min)
- **Random Events** - Cost spikes, capacity drops, traffic bursts every 15-45 seconds
- **Traffic Shifts** - Traffic patterns change every 40 seconds
- **DDoS Spikes** - 50% malicious traffic waves every 45 seconds
- **Service Degradation** - Services lose health under load, require repairs

**New UI Features:**

- Health bars on all services
- Active event indicator bar at top
- Detailed finances panel (income/expenses breakdown)
- Service health panel with repair costs
- Auto-repair toggle
- Game over analysis with tips

#### Sandbox Mode

A fully customizable testing environment for experimenting with any architecture:

| Control           | Description                                                       |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Budget**        | Set any starting budget (slider 0-10K, or type any amount)        |
| **RPS**           | Control traffic rate (0 = stopped, or type 100+ for stress tests) |
| **Traffic Mix**   | Adjust all 6 traffic type percentages independently               |
| **Burst**         | Spawn instant bursts of specific traffic types                    |
| **Upkeep Toggle** | Enable/disable service costs                                      |
| **Clear All**     | Reset all services and restore budget                             |

**No game over in Sandbox** - experiment freely!

### Controls

- **Left Click:** Select tools, place services, and connect nodes.
- **Right Click + Drag:** Pan the camera.
- **ESC:** Open main menu and pause game. Press again or click Resume to close menu (stays paused).
- **Camera Reset:** Press `R` to reset the camera position.
- **Birds-Eye View:** Press `T` to switch between isometric and top-down view.
- **Hide HUD:** Press `H` to toggle UI panels.
- **Connect Tool:** Click two nodes to create a connection (flow direction matters!).
  - _Valid Flows:_ Internet -> WAF -> ALB -> SQS -> Compute -> Cache -> (DB/S3)
- **Delete Tool:** Remove services to recover 50% of the cost.
- **Time Controls:** Pause, Play (1x), and Fast Forward (3x).

## Strategy Tips

1.  **Block Attacks First:** Always place a WAF immediately connected to the Internet. Malicious leaks destroy reputation fast (-5 per leak).
2.  **Watch Service Health:** Damaged services have reduced capacity. Click to repair or enable Auto-Repair.
3.  **Scale for Traffic Surges:** RPS multiplies at milestones - prepare before ×2.0 at 3 minutes!
4.  **Balance Income vs Upkeep:** Start lean, scale as income grows. Over-provisioning leads to bankruptcy.
5.  **Use Cache Wisely:** Reduces database load significantly for READ requests.
6.  **Buffer with SQS:** Queue helps survive traffic burst events without dropping requests.
7.  **React to Events:** Watch the event bar - cost spikes mean hold off on purchases, traffic bursts mean ensure capacity.

## Tech Stack

- **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D visualization.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the glassmorphism UI.
- **Build:** No build step required! Just standard HTML/CSS/JS.

## Getting Started
